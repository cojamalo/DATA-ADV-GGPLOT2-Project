## Reference plot
The goal of this project is to demonstrate plotting skills in R to recreate the following professional plot that appeared in <i>The Economist</i> magazine. Everything is done from scratch using `ggplot2`:


![Source plot to recreate.](/Users/cojamalo/Documents/GitHub/DATA-ADV-GGPLOT2-Project/Economist1.png)
<br>

## Load data
The data was supplied by the "Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp with R" Udemy course:
```{r}
plot_data <- fread("Economist_Assignment_Data.csv", na.strings = "", showProgress = FALSE) %>% tbl_df
```
<br>

## Clean data
Check the data to make sure it is in a good format for plotting:
```{r}
summary(plot_data)
```

Everything looks good except for `Region`. This variable will be converted to a factor variable because it is categorical:
```{r}
plot_data$Region <- factor(plot_data$Region)
```

The `Region` variable also has to be revalued and reordered to have the same names and ordering:
```{r}
plot_data$Region <- revalue(plot_data$Region, c("EU W. Europe" = "OECD" , "Americas" = "Americas", "Asia Pacific" = "Asia & Oceania", "East EU Cemt Asia" = "Central & Eastern Europe", "MENA" = "Middle East & north Africa", "SSA" = "Sub-Saharan Africa"))
plot_data$Region <- factor(plot_data$Region, levels(plot_data$Region)[c(4, 1:3, 5:6)])
```

Other miscellaneous changes had to be made to the data since the source data was not labeled the exact same as <i>The Economist</i> plot:
```{r}
plot_data[plot_data$Country == "United States",]$Country <- "US"
plot_data[plot_data$Country == "Romania",]$CPI <- 11 # Make it disappear (Could be different data for why its missing)
plot_data[plot_data$Country == "Australia",]$Region <- "OECD"
plot_data[plot_data$Country == "Canada",]$Region <- "OECD"
plot_data[plot_data$Country == "Chile",]$Region <- "OECD"
plot_data[plot_data$Country == "Cyprus",]$Region <- "Central & Eastern Europe"
plot_data[plot_data$Country == "Israel",]$Region <- "OECD"
plot_data[plot_data$Country == "Japan",]$Region <- "OECD"
plot_data[plot_data$Country == "Korea (South)",]$Region <- "OECD"
plot_data[plot_data$Country == "Lithuania",]$Region <- "Central & Eastern Europe"
plot_data[plot_data$Country == "Malta",]$Region <- "Central & Eastern Europe"
plot_data[plot_data$Country == "Mexico",]$Region <- "OECD"
plot_data[plot_data$Country == "New Zealand",]$Region <- "OECD"
plot_data[plot_data$Country == "Turkey",]$Region <- "OECD"
plot_data[plot_data$Country == "US",]$Region <- "OECD"
plot_data[plot_data$Country == "Sudan",]$Region <- "Middle East & north Africa"
```
<br>

## Recreate the Plot

### Geom_point layer and settings
First, the data is plotted using a `geom_point` layer and colored according to each country's region. Other aesthetic settings were included to make the points look like the colored circles in the reference plot:
```{r}
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = CPI, y = HDI, color = Region)) + 
    geom_point(size = 2.5, shape = 21, fill = "white", stroke = 1)
finished_layers <- list(geom_point(size = 2.5, shape = 21, fill = "white", stroke = 1))
```

### Geom_smooth layer and settings
A regression line for the log(CPI) is added to the plot using `geom_smooth`, resized, colored red, and extended to the full range of the plot:
```{r}
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = CPI, y = HDI, color = Region)) + 
    finished_layers +
    geom_smooth(method= "lm", formula = y ~ log(x), se = FALSE, color = "red", size = 0.5, fullrange = TRUE)
finished_layers <- list(finished_layers, geom_smooth(method= "lm", formula = y ~ log(x), se = FALSE, color = "red", size = 0.5, fullrange = TRUE))
```
<br>

### Geom_text layer and settings
Next, the labels are added to the plot using `geom_text`, resized, and then nudged into the right positions:
```{r}
pointsToLabel <- c("Russia", "Venezuela", "Iraq", "Myanmar", "Sudan",
                   "Afghanistan", "Congo", "Greece", "Argentina", "Brazil",
                   "India", "Italy", "China", "South Africa", "Spain",
                   "Botswana", "Cape Verde", "Bhutan", "Rwanda", "France",
                   "US", "Germany", "Britain", "Barbados", "Norway", "Japan",
                   "New Zealand", "Singapore")
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = CPI, y = HDI, color = Region)) + 
    finished_layers +
    geom_text(aes(label = Country), color = "gray20", data = subset(plot_data, Country %in% pointsToLabel), check_overlap = FALSE, size = (5/14)*9, 
              nudge_x = c(-0.30, -0.450, 00.45, 0.40, 0.50, -0.220, 00.00, 0.600, 00.60, -0.30, -0.50, 0.00, -0.40, 0.3, -0.25, 0.00, 00.50, -0.25, 0.40, 0.00, -1.00, 0.45, 00.45, 00.60, -0.40, -0.40, 0.00, -0.55),    
              nudge_y = c(-0.04, 00.035, -0.03, 0.00, 0.03, 00.100, -0.03, 0.005, -0.02, -0.03, 00.06, 0.06, 00.02, 0.0, 00.00, 0.05, -0.06, 00.04, 0.03, 0.04, 00.07, 0.02, -0.03, -0.04, 00.07, 00.03, 0.04, 00.03))
finished_layers <- list(finished_layers, geom_text(aes(label = Country), color = "gray20", data = subset(plot_data, Country %in% pointsToLabel), check_overlap = FALSE, size = (5/14)*9, 
              nudge_x = c(-0.30, -0.450, 00.45, 0.40, 0.50, -0.220, 00.00, 0.600, 00.60, -0.30, -0.50, 0.00, -0.40, 0.3, -0.25, 0.00, 00.50, -0.25, 0.40, 0.00, -1.00, 0.45, 00.45, 00.60, -0.40, -0.40, 0.00, -0.55),    
              nudge_y = c(-0.04, 00.035, -0.03, 0.00, 0.03, 00.100, -0.03, 0.005, -0.02, -0.03, 00.06, 0.06, 00.02, 0.0, 00.00, 0.05, -0.06, 00.04, 0.03, 0.04, 00.07, 0.02, -0.03, -0.04, 00.07, 00.03, 0.04, 00.03)))
      
```
<br>

### Geom_segments and settings
The line segments needed for some of the countries are then added to the plot using `geom_segment`:
```{r}
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = CPI, y = HDI, color = Region)) + 
    finished_layers +
    geom_segment(x = 1.7, y = 0.82, xend = 2.4, yend = 0.755, size = 0.01, alpha = 0.7) + # Russia
    geom_segment(x = 3.6, y = 0.80, xend = 3.8, yend = 0.718, size = 0.01, alpha = 0.7) + # Brazil
    geom_segment(x = 3.95, y = 0.665, xend = 3.6, yend = 0.687, size = 0.01, alpha = 0.7) + # China
    geom_segment(x = 4.2, y = 0.59, xend = 4.1, yend = 0.619, size = 0.01, alpha = 0.7) + # South Africa
    geom_segment(x = 6.05, y = 0.94, xend = 6.2, yend = 0.878, size = 0.01, alpha = 0.7) + # Spain
    geom_segment(x = 6.8, y = 0.94, xend = 7, yend = 0.884, size = 0.01, alpha = 0.7) + # France
    geom_segment(x = 8, y = 0.945, xend = 8, yend = 0.92, size = 0.01, alpha = 0.7) + # Germany
    geom_segment(x = 8.3, y = 0.85, xend = 8, yend = 0.901, size = 0.01, alpha = 0.7) # Japan
finished_layers <- list(finished_layers, geom_segment(x = 1.7, y = 0.82, xend = 2.4, yend = 0.755, size = 0.01, alpha = 0.7), geom_segment(x = 3.6, y = 0.80, xend = 3.8, yend = 0.718, size = 0.01, alpha = 0.7),geom_segment(x = 3.95, y = 0.665, xend = 3.6, yend = 0.687, size = 0.01, alpha = 0.7), geom_segment(x = 4.2, y = 0.59, xend = 4.1, yend = 0.619, size = 0.01, alpha = 0.7), geom_segment(x = 6.05, y = 0.94, xend = 6.2, yend = 0.878, size = 0.01, alpha = 0.7), geom_segment(x = 6.8, y = 0.94, xend = 7, yend = 0.884, size = 0.01, alpha = 0.7), geom_segment(x = 8, y = 0.945, xend = 8, yend = 0.92, size = 0.01, alpha = 0.7), geom_segment(x = 8.3, y = 0.85, xend = 8, yend = 0.901, size = 0.01, alpha = 0.7))
```
<br>

### Scale color manual and settings
After that, the `Region` colors are recolored and the newlines are added for the long region names using `scale_color_manual`:
```{r}
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = CPI, y = HDI, color = Region)) + 
    finished_layers +
    scale_colour_manual(name = NULL,values = c('#01344A','#228DBD','#6DBBD8','#1B6E64','#D24131','#621107'), labels = c("OECD","Americas","Asia & \nOceania","Central & \nEastern Europe","Middle East & \nnorth Africa", "Sub-Saharan \nAfrica"))
finished_layers <- list(finished_layers, scale_colour_manual(name = NULL,values = c('#01344A','#228DBD','#6DBBD8','#1B6E64','#D24131','#621107'), labels = c("OECD","Americas","Asia & \nOceania","Central & \nEastern Europe","Middle East & \nnorth Africa", "Sub-Saharan \nAfrica")))
```
<br>

### Scale continuous for both axes and settings
Both axes are extended to the proper lengths and breaks are set to match the reference plots using `scale_x_continous` and `scale_y_continous`: 
```{r}
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = CPI, y = HDI, color = Region)) + 
    finished_layers +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 10), breaks = c(1:10)) +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.2,1), breaks = c(0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0))
finished_layers <- list(finished_layers, scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 10), breaks = c(1:10)), scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.2,1), breaks = c(0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0)))   
```
<br>

### Plot labels and settings
The plot is then properly labeled using a `labs` layer:
```{r}
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = CPI, y = HDI, color = Region)) + 
    finished_layers +
    labs(title = "Corruption and human development", y = "Human Development Index, 2011 (1=best)", x = "Corruption Perceptions Index, 2011 (10=least corrupt)", caption = "Sources: Transparency International; UN Development Report")
finished_layers <- list(finished_layers, labs(title = "Corruption and human development", y = "Human Development Index, 2011 (1=best)", x = "Corruption Perceptions Index, 2011 (10=least corrupt)", caption = "Sources: Transparency International; UN Development Report")) 
```
<br>

### Theme settings
Finally, the legend is moved to its proper position and shape using `guides` and `theme`. `theme_bw` is added to quickly change many theme settings to match the reference, and many more theme settings are set manually until the plot is complete:
```{r}
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = CPI, y = HDI, color = Region)) + 
    finished_layers +
    guides(colour = guide_legend(nrow = 1)) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.position="top", panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(), legend.justification = 0, plot.title = element_text(face = 'bold'), axis.title = element_text(face = 'italic', size = 8), plot.caption = element_text(size = 8, hjust = 0), panel.border = element_blank(), axis.line.x = element_line(color = "black"), axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.length=unit(-0.1, "cm"),axis.text.x = element_text(margin=unit(c(0.5,0.5,0,0), "cm")))
```
<br>


## Final comments
Compare the above recreated plot to the reference plot below:
![Source plot to recreate.](/Users/cojamalo/Documents/GitHub/DATA-ADV-GGPLOT2-Project/Economist1.png)

The recreated plot is very similar to the reference plot. Some of following key issues remain, but are not addressed:

* The correct font is missing. <i>The Economist</i> uses a different font than the default font used in ggplot. If the exact name of the font was known, it could be possible to fix this.
* Some of the longer country name labels feature a new line such as "South Africa", but this was not fixed in the recreation.
* The R^2 value is missing from the legend
* It is clear that the supplied data is not exactly the same as what <i>The Economist</i> used, or they edited their data in an unknown way. Miscellaneous data errors and region classifications remain in the recreation compared to the reference plot.
* The x-axis looks a little different as its line extends past 1 in the recreation
* Other small spacing, margin, etc difference - of course, not everything is in the exact right spot since most positions were estimated.
